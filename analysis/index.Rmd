Welcome to the website for our LIFE4141 population genomics practical. Today we are going to:

1. [Perform a PCA on some haplochromine cichlid data](practical1.html)
2. [Carry out a sliding window-analysis of *F*<sub>ST</sub> and *d*<sub>XY</sub> on a dataset of *Passer* sparrows](practical2.html)
3. [Calculate haplotype homozygosity statistics between two *Passer* sparrow species](practical3.html)
4. [Use this pairwise analysis to identify candidate genes in the genome](practical4.html)
